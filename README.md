This repository contains the code of the Controller developed for my Bachelor thesis titled "Development of a Fuzzy Controller for Shared Control Digital Twin Enabled Teleoperated Driving". Next to the code for the controller the repository contains other helper functions, scripts and ROS nodes developed for Testing the controller. The results of the experimental validation are also in this repository.
